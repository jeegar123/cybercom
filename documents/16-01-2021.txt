Today i learned ,first-classs function in which how we can return function,how clousre work wth lexical scoping.
how IIFFE works,in which we can encapsulate data (data privacy)
then i learned bind,call,apply functions 
in this bind we create a duplicate object and bind it with it.
call and apply are same but difference in argument apply we can send array as extra paarmeter
this all 3 functions works on this keyword .

then i started ES6
i leanred let,var,const and thier scoping,differce.
then i leanred block how its usefull and differnt from IIFFE

then i look assignment ,i start working on it ,but css part was difficult form as usal but somehow i set it up
