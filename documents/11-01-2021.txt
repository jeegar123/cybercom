In Javascript ,Today i learned control statement like if else,switch,ternary operator .then i started function 
and learned how different types of function like arrow functions,clousers ,inner and outer function,..
then about function parameters like regular paramater,reset paramater,how inner function can acces outer parameter.
how function expression works .At last array and perfrom some operation like push unshift,reduce ...


then,i start working with assignement .and i used some boostrap for cards layout and customize with css .then perfrom table layout which was easy.then i started with prettie ma'am challenge questions file-upload and resset btn challenge was easy but last password challenge was too tricky and hard for me.In this password challenge i want to perfrom that chnage password . symbol to * symbol. i tried and find of internet but nothing working for me .at last i didnt find anything and get it that was not working for me or i didn't implement well .but i adjust it with my logic ,somehow i change it as per challenge but real scenario its not applicable becz i change the original password value directly that was bad,may be i'll get idea in next meeting.
