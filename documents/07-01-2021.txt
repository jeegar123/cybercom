Today i was learning gitignore file and i knew that how we can ignore some files from git  .Then i found some interesting about commit that we can search string commit message so i start practice it using --grep "search string" on log command.and i also found one command that can tell log of some lines in particular lines "git log -L intial line no. ,final line no.:filename" . then i found that shortlog command that can differntiate the author and give short comment message.at last i found one more "reflog" command that tell every thing what user have perform action .i like this command to easy check every details .

After sir meeting,

i even  learned reset soft,hard,mixed ,in which don't use hard unless senior guide.otherwise it mess for others.

i learned something about submodules too ,in which we can create submodule part in our repo and clone other repo to within our repo.if we need some function from submodules we can import like library.

i also learned how software tool are great against command line for git (representation only).As i use Vscode  gitlens only but after watching graph on sir's screen and i start searching and i found extension for Vscode and its good representaion of graph for github.

After working 3 days traninng on github and some greate live session with sir for queries ,Now I'm confident about the git commands to perform .
