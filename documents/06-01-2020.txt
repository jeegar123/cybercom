today i learned git remote commands .i create 1 repo in another account  and clone into my system but my local system has another account  so i can't push changes but i can fetch it.so i came to know about remote command so i fork that project into my github account and clone it to local now i can push changes to forked repo ,by using remote i can evn get fetch data from main project that i fork .

I learned how to do pull request from Github ui and i leaned how to do remote branches pull request.i also learned how to delete local and remote branches  using git command


So i leaned how to work with remote repo by fork that repo
