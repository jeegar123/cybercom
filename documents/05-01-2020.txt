today i learned about git and perform some commands of git like add commit,merge,push,log,show,pull branch,,staged. 

I completed sir task for github and try some commands on some repos. then i make one repo in which i divided  repo in 3 branches  so i could practice more with it link:https://github.com/jeegar123/testing-web-pp.git ,At some point i generate errors too like conflict,forget commit message .but i even resolve it  and complete the work

By the end of meeting,i learned lot's of query's answer of different trannies like why ssh needed,if conflict come what to do.....


Thank you
